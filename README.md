What if Google could write a poem? What if Google autocomplete could be used to complete a 50,000 word poem? The result can be seen [here](https://github.com/edsu/google-the-poem/blob/master/poem_en.txt). It's my entry for [NaNoGenMo 2014](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/71).

## Run

    npm install
    node run.js > poem.txt

## Configure

Not much thought has gone into usability, but you can play with the `seed`,
`language`, `verbProbability` and `stanzaLines` variables at the top of 
`googly_vogonicus.js` if you want to experiment.

Pull requests are welcome.
