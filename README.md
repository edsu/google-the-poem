# Googly Vogonicus

Googly Vogonicus is an epic poem generated from Google's auto-suggest. I found the source code on a USB stick in the smoking remains of a [Vogon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon) battleship, named the Aspargus Turbine. It seems to have been some failed experiment to communicate with the human race via the one remaining fully public free web service API offered by Google.

Googly Vogonicus is also my entry for [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/85). You can also see a more dynamic version of this poem on the [World Wide Web](http://inkdroid.org/vogon).

## Run

    npm install
    node googly_vogonicus.js > poem.txt

## Configure

Not much thought has gone into usability, but you can play with the `seed`,
`verbProbability` and `stanzaLines` variables at the top of 
`googly_vogonicus.js` if you want to experiment. Pull requests are welcome.
