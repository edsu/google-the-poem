What if Google could write a poem? What if Google autocomplete could be used to
complete a 50,000 word poem?

## Run

    npm install
    node run.js > poem.txt

## Configure

Not much thought has gone into usability, but you can play with the `seed`,
`language`, `verbProbability` and `stanzaLines` variables at the top of 
`googly_vogonicus.js` if you want to experiment.

Pull requests are welcome.
